        <h3>History of blockchain</h3>
        <p>
          The blockchain method was initially developed in 1991, but not
          intended for the purpose it is used for today (uses will be discussed
          further in the report). In 1991, research scientists Stuart Haber and
          W. Scott Stornetta in their peak of scientific developments, were
          attempting to develop a platform on which digital documents could be
          stored and backed up to allow easy access. The blockchain back then
          was used to make the timestamps of the documents and to make them
          ultimately more secure so they can’t be manipulated or changed.
          However, the blockchain model was further developed in 2008 by a team
          under the control of a man named Satoshi Nakamoto. It has not been
          confirmed however, it is alleged that his team developed the
          pre-existing blockchain network to use it as a digital ledger system
          for transaction. And this gave rise to the much-heard cryptocurrency
          Bitcoin. And in 2009, the ‘newly developed’ blockchain method was
          utilised and a transaction was created under the chain to man named
          Hal Finey, and since the, just under the Bitcoin crypto network over
          750 million trades have occurred under the blockchain network just for
          one cryptocurrency (bitcoin). This is just one example which indicates
          that the blockchain network was a great success in launching such a
          well renowned cryptocurrency and start a foundation for other digital
          currencies to be born.

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          In the current world, the reliance on technology and electronic
          transaction is increasing exponentially every year. As the demand for
          online transaction increases the burden on central clearing authority
          is increasing resulting in long wait times for large transfers (for
          example to purchase a house) the transfer may take 2-3 days depending
          on the amount and requiring clearance by authorities. While on the
          other hand, using the decentralized ledger system (blockchain), the
          transaction occur across a peer-to-peer network, this allows parties
          to have transactions cleared in a matter of minutes without requiring
          approvals and clearance authentication from authorities. Blockchain
          records are immutable meaning that they are subject to zero
          manipulation and alteration as it will just not allow the future
          transactions to be tracked. This key feature of blockchain allows it
          to be used in a very important way, keeping track of medications and
          prescribed drugs to individuals who require regular prescriptions.
          When talking about prescriptions, the record keeping for the collected
          medication and the stock take could vary due to human error in record
          keeping. So much so, that according to a research article published by
          The University of Nottingham, focused on investigating the errors
          which occur in pharmacies on prescribing. They found that over a
          12-month period, ‘around one in eight patients were exposed to a
          prescribing or monitoring error’. This shows that in such a small size
          of 1777 patients, mismanagement of prescriptions is a big problem and
          a waste to society. Keeping record of medication is very important to
          reduce misuse and prevent wastage in addition to minimising losses for
          the public health network.

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>
          At present, although many large organisations have implemented or are
          in the process of implementing the blockchain network into their
          business activates there are some limitations that some may face.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Poor adoption: Due to the young technology which only began
          widespread use in 2009 and primary intended for cryptocurrency it
          hasn’t quite entered the widespread community yet. However, as more
          business see that their business will be enhanced through the use of
          this technology it will be adopted more. <br>- Difficulty to make
          revisions: One disadvantage at present is that there is no possible
          way to make revisions to the Blockchain. If a clerical error does
          occur, it is impossible to revise the transaction and instead will
          require a whole new transaction to refund/reimburse the error. This
          may deter businesses from this technology as it will increase the
          clerical time required. <br>- Looks complicated: The blockchain is not
          very easy to express and understand in laymans terms and hence it is
          hard to get the older generation on board which also contributes to
          the reduced uptake of this techonology.
